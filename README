This is a working prototype of the TT3 (Template Toolkit V3) template
language.  It will eventually become the release version of TT3.

Everything is still very much under construction so don't expect anything
production-ready just yet.  However, most of the important functionality
is now in place.

At present all modules are contained under the Template::TT3 namespace.
They will eventually become the new Template::* modules and the current 
TT2 modules will be moved permanently into Template::TT2::*.  But that's
a while off yet.

You'll need to install the latest development version of Badger from 
github.

  $ git clone git://github.com/abw/Badger.git
  $ cd Badger
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ sudo make install
  $ cd ..

The clone the Template-TT3 repository, make and install it.

  $ git clone git://github.com/abw/Template-TT3.git
  $ cd Template-TT3
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test       # expect some failures

The documentation for TT3 is sparse right now.  The Template3 module has
some basic documentation to get you started.  You might like to browse
through the annotated slides for the presentation I gave at the 2009
London Perl Workshop.  This should give you an idea about some of the 
new things you can do.

You might also want to take a glance at some of the test scripts to see
some examples of what can be done.
