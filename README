This is a working prototype of the TT3 (Template Toolkit V3) template
language.  It's very much under construction at the moment but will 
eventually become the release version of TT3.

At present all modules are contained under the Template::TT3 namespace.
They will eventually become the new Template::* modules and the current 
TT2 modules will be moved permanently into Template::TT2::*.  But that's
a while off yet.

Everything is still very much under construction so don't expect anything
production-ready just yet.

You'll need the latest development version of Badger from the subversion
repository (which I'll get around to moving to github RSN).  See 
http://badgerpower.com/.  Releasing version 0.07 is also RSN.

With the Badger in place:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test

That's about all you can do right now.  You'll have to look at the tests
for more inspiration.
