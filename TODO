Elements have text() method to return $self->[TEXT] and text() method to 
evaluate self ($self->value) and return text.  Need to change/rename one
or other.

Delete position() and other source methods from T::Type::Text

Change 'block' element type to something non-generic like 'tt_block' 
(and prohibit tt_ prefixes on keywords) to avoid clash with 'block'
keywords directives.  The grammar always chooses the block keyword over
the core block element.

Make if look for elsif/else

Handle the end / } terminator.  If it's 'end' then we shouldn't parse on
to the next elsif / else.

Figure out what non-chaining infix operators should do.

Resolve problem with generators wanting different arguments/behaviours
depending on them being token or tree views.  Perhaps better to just 
have the element call $gen->generate_XXX($self) and let the generator
unpack/evaluate it as required.
