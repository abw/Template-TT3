There's lots TODO.  This file contains a few notes to remind me about 
some of the things that need to be done.  It is in no way meant to be 
a comprehensive list.

Delete position() and other source methods from T::Type::Text

Change 'block' element type to something non-generic like 'tt_block' 
(and prohibit tt_ prefixes on keywords) to avoid clash with 'block'
keywords directives.  The grammar always chooses the block keyword over
the core block element.

Make if look for elsif/else

Handle the end / } terminator.  If it's 'end' then we shouldn't parse on
to the next elsif / else.

Figure out what non-chaining infix operators should do.

Figure out why element classes aren't being loaded.  e.g. declaring 
[ TAGS => ctr_tags => 0, 0 ] should load T::TT3::Element::Control::Tags
and fail if it doesn't exists.  The find() method appears to be returning
the class name without checking to see if it can be loaded.

Add name(), pair() and pairs() methods to all elements that require them.
