There's lots TODO.  This file contains a few notes to remind me about 
some of the things that need to be done.  It is in no way meant to be 
a comprehensive list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elements have text() method to return $self->[TEXT] and text() method to 
evaluate self ($self->value) and return text.  Need to change/rename one
or other.

Delete position() and other source methods from T::Type::Text

Change 'block' element type to something non-generic like 'tt_block' 
(and prohibit tt_ prefixes on keywords) to avoid clash with 'block'
keywords directives.  The grammar always chooses the block keyword over
the core block element.

Make if look for elsif/else

Handle the end / } terminator.  If it's 'end' then we shouldn't parse on
to the next elsif / else.

Figure out what non-chaining infix operators should do.

Resolve problem with generators wanting different arguments/behaviours
depending on them being token or tree views.  Perhaps better to just 
have the element call $gen->generate_XXX($self) and let the generator
unpack/evaluate it as required.

Figure out why element classes aren't being loaded.  e.g. declaring 
[ TAGS => ctr_tags => 0, 0 ] should load T::TT3::Element::Control::Tags
and fail if it doesn't exists.  The find() method appears to be returning
the class name without checking to see if it can be loaded.
